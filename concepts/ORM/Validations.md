# Validations

Sails bundles support for automatic validations of your models' attributes. Any time a record is updated, or a new record is created, the data for each attribute will be checked against all of your predefined validation rules. This provides a convenient failsafe to ensure that invalid entries don't make their way into your app's database(s).

### Validation Rules

Validations are handled by [Anchor](https://github.com/balderdashy/anchor), a thin layer on top of [Validator](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js), one of the most robust validation libraries for Node.js.  Sails supports most of the validations available in Validator, as well as a few extras that require database integration, like `unique`.
